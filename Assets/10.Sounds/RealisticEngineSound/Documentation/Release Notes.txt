- Added an option to change Audio Velocity Update Mode (this will help to fix audio stuttering, a rare problem that appeared only with some car physics controllers)
- Changed "Optimise Audio Sources" "Pause" mode, it is now renamed to "Pause Fastly" (which sometime cause small click and pop noises), and added another mode "Pause Slowly" which will optimise the audio slower, but without any click and pop noises
- Slightly improved "Pause Fastly" mode of "Optimise Audio Sources" (previously it was named as "Pause" mode), it will less likely cause click and pop noises
- Fixed a bug that broke the "Rev Limiter Tweaker" (bug was exist since v2.1.3)

----------------------------------------
v2.1.4
- Hotfix for IRDS compatibility: fixed a bug that caused errors in IRDS car selection scene
----------------------------------------
v2.1.3
- Added compatibility for IRDS (both source and closed source versions)
- Updated Documentation.pdf
- Fixed a bug in medium and low quality prefabs when "Max RPM" sound clip were using the wrong pitch values
- Audio Sources will try to fadeout their volume to 0 before they get paused or destroyed, it's slightly reduces the chance of audio "click" noises when Audio Optimisation is enabled in engine sound prefabs - mostly noticeable in interior prefabs.
  Temporary solution is to disable Audio Optimisation in interior prefabs. It seem like this is a bug in Unity's audio - audio pause will cause a "click" noise even when audio source's volume is faded out to 0.
----------------------------------------

- Fixed a bug in demo controller scripts, not detecting disabled engine sound prefabs

- Fixed a bug in NWH2_RES2.cs script, not disabling engine sound prefabs when car's engine is not running
- Small fixes in editor script
----------------------------------------
